Hi there! Here is my first pet-project.
____
## _**Launch**_:

Best way is using VS Code, in which you should open project-folder, then open 2 terminals. After it you should use next commands.

### **First terminal (Client):**

`cd client`

`npm i`

`npm run start`

### **Second terminal (Server):**

`cd server`

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

Next step is open two browsers (or your browser and it's own incognito mode) -> register two users -> send messages.

You always can change database/hosts on server/.env.

Thank you for watching and any comments/ideas for improvement!
